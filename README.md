# MAGD 150 Assignments
## Readme File

Here are assignments 1 through 5 for MAGD 150.

## Assignment 1

[Static Composition in Black and White](https://github.com/crosssm16/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab01_cross/s19magd150lab01_cross.pde)

A black and white 2D composition using only simple shapes and grayscale color. I created a simple futuristic city skyline and drew my name using lines.

## Assignment 2

[Color Composition](https://github.com/crosssm16/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab02_cross/s19magd150lab02_cross.pde)

A composition using shapes and color. The theme was planets. I had a tough time trying to get two arcs to match up correctly to create a weird-looking planet, so I used two different shapes instead.

## Assignment 3

[Math](https://github.com/crosssm16/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab03_cross/s19magd150lab03_cross.pde)

A composition created using addition and subtraction applied to shapes. The theme was bubbles, so I drew a bunch of multicolored bubbles that grow or shrink until they get to a certain size. There are also two that are mapped to the location of the mouse.

## Assignment 4

[Dynamism](https://github.com/crosssm16/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab04_cross/s19magd150lab04_cross.pde)

A composition using mouse-based interaction, if-else statements, and for/while loops. The theme was pizza, so I focused on adding toppings to a slice of pizza. The user can make green peppers or pepperoni appear by pressing G or P respectively. A dot of "sauce" also follows the mouse. My intention was to have the sauce appear permanently on the slice upon click, but I couldn't get this to work.

## Assignment 5

[Intersections](https://github.com/crosssm16/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab05_cross/bubbles.pde)

A composition based on outer space that required mouse interaction and growing/shrinking of an object. I created a button that activates on click and makes an alien face appear. I wanted to have two buttons, one that makes it appear and one that makes it disappear, but I couldn't get this to work so I went with just one button.
